# IoT-SmartParking

## About:
This is a group project developed for the Internet of Things (IoT) course of University of West Attica (UniWA).

This project expands on a pre-existing idea of automatically tracked parking spots that notify users of availability into a completely autonomous system used in private parkings (i.e. shopping mall parking).

The goal for the project is to be "endlessly" expandable while utilizing cheap and long-lasting sensors.

## Requirements for Each Cluster:
- Up to 16 Contactless Magnetic Hall sensors
- 1 Wireless Transceiver module
- 1 Arduino

## Requirements for the System:
- 1 RFID reader
- 1 Arduino
- 1 Raspberry Pi
- N Clusters 

## Architecture:
